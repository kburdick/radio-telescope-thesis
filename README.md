# radio-telescope-thesis
Part of my Senior Thesis for Physics

This project is about creating a low-noise 1.4GHz radio receiver that is reasonably low-cost and can be reprogrammed for additional future use cases. 

My involvement is determining a way to use the Signal Hound SA-44B Spectrum Analyzer and their API to program an application in C++ that will allow me to reliably collect data from the new version of the Small Radio Telescope at Ithaca College. 

Currently this is the test of the spectrum analyzer device to ensure that proper library files were installed and this confirms that the divice is ready to be programmed for our radio telescope and the project requirements.

More to come in the future as I am currently working on this project.
