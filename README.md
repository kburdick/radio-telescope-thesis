Part of my Senior Thesis for my Bachelor's Degree in Physics (Ithaca College 2020)

This project is about creating a low-noise 1.4GHz radio receiver that is reasonably low-cost and can be reprogrammed for additional future academic physics research at Ithaca College. 

I was involved in in this project by determining a way to use the Signal Hound SA-44B USB Spectrum Analyzer and Signal Hounds API to program an application in C++ that allowed me to reliably collect data from the new version of the Small Radio Telescope at Ithaca College. The new receiver for the telescope is based on the SRT (small radio telescope) at Haystack Observatory, which is part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  

When testing the spectrum analyzer device students must ensure that proper library files are installed and confirm that the device is ready to be programmed for the radio telescope and the project requirements. Once data is successfully collected, students can use the R programs to plot and conduct preliminary analysis on their data.

This project was conducted as part of my senior thesis titled "Receiver Configuration and Software Tools for the Ithaca College Radio Telescope" and it was awarded "Outstanding Senior Thesis" by the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Ithaca College.
